**WinCMP** is a modern, portable local development environment control panel designed specifically for Windows. 
The name is derived from **Win**dows + **C**addy + **M**ariaDB + **P**HP.

Inspired by XAMPP and Laragon, WinCMP aims to provide a more lightweight, **portable (no installation required)**, and **mostly admin-privilege-free** development solution (excluding optional Hosts file modifications). Built with Go core and the Wails v2 framework, it features a premium React 18 frontend with extremely low resource usage, fast startup speeds, and beautiful visual aesthetics.

## ✨ Features

- 🪶 **Extremely Lightweight**: Statically compiled in Go + Wails, leveraging the native OS web engine (WebView2) without Electron dependencies.
- 🛡️ **No Admin Privileges Needed for Core Services**: Fully supports running under restricted environments without modifying system environment variables or writing to the registry. *(Note: Automatic writing to the Windows `hosts` file for custom domains is optional and requires Administrator elevation/UAC prompt).*
- 🎨 **Modern UI/UX**: Premium Dark Professional theme with smooth sidebar navigation, real-time status monitoring, and interactive micro-animations.
- 🔄 **PHP Multi-Process Load Balancing**: Leverages Caddy's upstream mechanism to run multiple FastCGI processes for each PHP version.
- 📂 **Automated Project Management**: Visually manage Laravel, Next.js, Nuxt, Astro, Vite, Python, Go, and other projects. Automatically detects frameworks and generates configurations.
- 🚀 **Runtime Multi-Environment Execution**: Supports Node.js, Bun, Python, Go (Air/Run), and Custom development environments, with options to start in Background or Terminal mode.
- 📜 **Isolated Environments**: Dynamically injects `PATH` when launching subprocesses to ensure PHP and its extensions run in the correct binary environments.

## 📁 Project Architecture & Directory Layout

To achieve "plug-and-play" simplicity, WinCMP strictly adheres to the following directory structure:

## 🛠️ Architecture & Under-the-Hood Logic

### 1. PHP Process Management & Port Mapping
WinCMP utilizes a **3-version-sequence** pattern to assign service ports, ensuring different versions of PHP can run concurrently without conflicts:
- **Naming Convention**: `3<Major><Minor><Sequence 00-99>`
  - PHP 7.3 → `37300`, `37301`, `37302`
  - PHP 8.2 → `38200`, `38201`, `38202`
- **Load Balancing**: Each PHP version starts 3 `php-cgi` processes by default. WinCMP defines `php_fastcgi 127.0.0.1:38200 127.0.0.1:38201 ...` in Caddyfile to balance the requests.

### 2. Dynamic Caddy Configuration
When a user updates project settings in the UI:
1. `conf/wincmp.json` is updated.
2. The Go application rewrites `conf/sites/{project}.caddy`.
3. Calls `caddy reload` for a zero-downtime hot reload.

### 3. Dynamic Environment Variables Injection
To avoid modifying the system's global `PATH`, WinCMP prepends the corresponding binary directories to the subprocess's `Env` list via `os/exec` (e.g., when launching PHP), ensuring that extensions and dependencies locate their correct DLLs.

## 🚀 Development & Compilation

### 1. Prerequisites
- [Go 1.26.2+](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Wails CLI](https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation/): Make sure Wails v2 is installed on your system. Otherwise install it using `go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/cmd/wails@latest`.
- C Compiler: MinGW-w64 (WinLibs) for compiling underlying native Windows bindings. Make sure `gcc -v` works.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Node.js 18+ for compiling frontend components.

### 2. Development Hot Reload
```cmd
# Start Wails dev server (watches both Go backend and React frontend)
wails dev
```

### 3. Build Commands
```cmd
# Tidy Go modules & frontend packages
go mod tidy
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..

# Build with debug console and developer tools
wails build -debug

# Release build (no CMD window console, outputs wincmp.exe)
wails build -clean

# Production build with stripped symbols for size optimization
wails build -clean -ldflags "-s -w"
```

- [x] **Service Uptime Tracker** (independent stats for Caddy, MariaDB, and PHP).
- [x] **Laravel Auto-Detection** (confidence score system, automatically routing to `public/`).
- [x] **Port Conflict Check** (runs checks before launch to minimize race conditions).
- [x] **Hosts File Auto-Management** (automatically syncs local domains after prompting for UAC elevation).
- [x] **Dark/Light Theme Toggle** (integrated with Tailwind CSS).
- [x] **Runtime Multi-Environment Support** (Node.js, Bun, Python, Go Air/Run, Custom).
- [x] **Framework Preset Auto-Detection** (Next.js, Nuxt, Astro, Vite, Django, FastAPI, Flask, PocketBase, Go API).
- [x] **Double Launch Mode for Runtimes** (Background / Terminal).
- [x] **Legacy Project Auto-Migration** (node_port → runtime_port, etc.).
- [x] **Mailpit Integration** (start/stop toggle on Dashboard and configuration dialog).

### ⏳ Planned
> **💡 For a detailed roadmap, technical analysis, and prioritization, please refer to the complete [Develop Task List](doc/develop_task_list.md).**

- **Deep OS Integration**: Windows auto-start on boot (`HKCU\Run`), one-click setup for Windows system environment path (`Path`).
- **Dev Toolchain**: Embedded Composer support (no `composer.phar` installation needed), PHP process watchdog with auto-recovery.
- **Advanced Service Manager**: HeidiSQL integration (preview & fast connection), automated downloader for service executables (Caddy/PHP/MariaDB multi-version).
